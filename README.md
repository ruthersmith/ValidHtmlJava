# ValidHtmlJava
This assignment uses the stack and queue implementations from the Java Collections API in order 
to build a program that determines whether an HTML page is well formatted.
In theory (though not often in practice), well formatted HTML requires that the tags are “balanced,” i.e.
that open tags are matched by their corresponding close tag in the correct order.
